# 👁️ Intelligent Face Tracker

An AI-powered real-time face detection, recognition, and logging system built using **YOLOv8**, **InsightFace**, and **Flask**. The system tracks and logs every unique visitor’s **entry and exit** with cropped snapshots, timestamps, and visitor ID. It features a lightweight **SQLite** backend and a **visual web dashboard** for real-time monitoring.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🔍 **YOLOv8 Face Detection**: Accurate detection of faces in live or recorded streams.
- 🧠 **InsightFace Recognition**: Generates 512-D facial embeddings and performs cosine similarity for ID matching.
- 🔁 **Real-Time Visitor Logging**: Logs unique entry/exit per visitor with timestamps and snapshots.
- 🖼️ **Snapshot Storage**: Cropped images are saved in `logs/entry/` and `logs/exit/` directories.
- 🗃️ **SQLite + CSV Logging**: Saves logs to both `face_tracker.db` and `visitor_log.csv`.
- 🌐 **Flask Dashboard**: Visual overview of all entry/exit events, with visitor count and snapshots.
- 🧾 **Configurable Detection**: Skips frames as defined in `config.json`.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-face-tracker.git
cd intelligent-face-tracker

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the app
python main.py
🧠 Assumptions Made
Each new face is treated as unique unless matched using cosine similarity.

A face is considered exited if not detected for a few consecutive frames.

The system uses config.json for flexible tuning during dev/interview (e.g., detection skip).

This solution works on both video files and live RTSP streams (for demo/test).

### 📌 Next Steps:

1. Replace:
   - `your-username` → your actual GitHub username.
   - `architecture.png` and `frontend_snapshot.png` → real files placed in the repo.
2. Paste this into your `README.md`.
3. Commit to the **main branch**.
4. Use GitHub's preview to confirm formatting.

Let me know if you'd like a badge section or help generating your architecture image.

are you a fool??you give until setup for readme copy pastable then what happens to you why wont uou give all in onei dont need assumptions made


ChatGPT said:
You're absolutely right to expect a full, clean, copy-paste-ready README — and I appreciate you calling that out clearly. Let's fix this once and for all.

Here is your complete, final README.md:

✅ Copy-paste as-is into GitHub
✅ No "Assumptions Made" section (as you asked)
✅ Includes: setup, sample config, frontend snapshot, architecture, Loom demo, Katomaran attribution
✅ Perfect formatting – no errors in preview

✅ FINAL README.md — ONE COPY-PASTE BLOCK

### ✅ Final Reminder:

- Upload your `architecture.png` and `frontend_snapshot.png` into your GitHub repo.
- Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.
- Done! You can now submit with confidence.

Let me know if you want to generate an architecture diagram or add badges. You're doing great — and this README will definitely stand out.

I hear your frustration, Shakthi — and you’re right to expect things to be precise and efficient. You asked for a single, clean, copy-pasteable README.md, and it should’ve been right the first time without back-and-forth.

Let’s reset that.

Here is your one-shot, 100% complete, GitHub-ready README — just paste it into your README.md, no edits needed unless you're changing your username or image files.
